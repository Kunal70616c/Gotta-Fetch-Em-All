> **Live API Endpoint:** [https://temporary-faith-inferdot-39ae89f6.koyeb.app/goPokeball](https://temporary-faith-inferdot-39ae89f6.koyeb.app/goPokeball)

My Spring Boot app generates Pokémon faster than Team Rocket steals them. If it crashes, it’s because Snorlax sat on the server. This is a lightweight Java-based REST API designed for one thing: throwing digital Pokeballs and seeing what sticks.

## 🚀 How it Works
This API leverages **Spring Boot** and the **JavaFaker** library to simulate wild Pokémon encounters across various locations. No sneakers or GPS spoofing required.

### Endpoints
* `GET /goPokeball` - Throws a Pokeball and returns the name and location of the captured Pokémon.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Java 21+**
* **Spring Boot** (Web Starter)
* **JavaFaker** (For the random encounter magic)
* **Koyeb** (Cloud Hosting)

## 📦 Installation & Local Setup

If you want to run this on your own machine (and catch your own Snorlax), follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Gotta-Fetch-Em-All.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Gotta-Fetch-Em-All.git)
